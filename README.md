# Stefan to Silicon Valley

This project was created as an addition to my application for the FAU Silicon Valley Spring School and the FAU Silicon Valley Fall school as well.. It was written entirely in [Flutter](https://flutter.io/).

The source code was written by me and is open for everyone to see. If you want to use any parts of this project please contact me.
