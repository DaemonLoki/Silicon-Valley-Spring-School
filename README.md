# Stefan to Silicon Valley

This project was created as an addition to my application for the FAU Silicon Valley Spring School. It was written entirely in [Flutter](https://flutter.io/).

The source code was written by me and is open for everyone to see. If you want to use any parts of this project please contact me.
